# Overview

I have developed an experimental platform for an Echo State Network (ESN)—a neural network used for time-series analysis—used in my research from technical college through university, and I have published it as a package on PyPI.<br>
To reach its current form, I spent several years repeatedly revisiting the design and rebuilding it from scratch multiple times.<br>
